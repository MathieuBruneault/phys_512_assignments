Code associated with each question is provided in the respective py files. 
The proofs for question 1 are provided in the question1 pdf file.
error_analysis_fun1.pdf is the the err vs delta plot for exp(x) in question 1 and error_analysis_fun1.pdf is the smae plot for exp(0.001x).
my_integral.pdf is the plot generated using my integrator in question 4 and quad_integral is the same plot generated using scipy.integrate.quad.
question1 will simply generate its plots, question 2 and 3 will print stuff and question4 will both print stuff and generate plots.
